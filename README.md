A simple editor for TSB-Wiki site. You can change things inside of it and once done, export it as a JSON.
JSON files are then converted back into html by me personally.

======== RULES ========
1. NO EDITING THE JSON AFTER BEING EXPORTED
2. You may goof around with the editor, but the JSON file that you send to me must be "professionally" made.
