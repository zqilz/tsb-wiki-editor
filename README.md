A simple editor for TSB-Wiki site. You can change things inside of it and once done, export it as a JSON.
JSON files are then converted back into html by me personally.

======== HOW TO USE ==========

1. Open the [website](https://zqilz.github.io/tsb-wiki-editor/)
2. Change everything. From name to guides.
   List of things to change:
    - Tech/Combo title
    - Description
    - Specs [learn more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M9B9KgN36WMnmYDnFmps6I1dnPQpTI86L-ZiNDSHvlk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.b9e5qkv0o7u3)
    - Video tutorials (use the same format)
    - Written guides
    - credit yourself (written by: {your name/nickname, will be displayed in contributors page}).
    - (optional) Link your self-credit with your socials. (e.g. "Written by: [zqil](https://www.youtube.com/@Zqily)")
4. You have all the tools you need at your disposal, even adding links.
5. Once you're finished editing the page, you can click "Save Changes", then "Download JSON". Name the file accordingly. (e.g. for shove extend, name it Shove-extend.json)
6. Send it to me via a discord server (I DO NOT ACCEPT DMS): http://discord.gg/guTq4922dm
7. For more regulations, click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IaEvYYH1N4D_qTT2LUEFPYKFYTvvjcpCmjgtEvQ3qdk/edit?usp=sharing)

=========== RULES ============
1. NO EDITING THE JSON AFTER BEING EXPORTED
2. You may goof around with the editor, but the JSON file that you send to me must be "professionally" made.
3. Do not put malicious code inside the editor.
